# IP & Port 

In (php-reverse-shell.php), You only need to change two things. It was IP and Port. You don't need to change port. but if you want, you can!

# Line-49
In line (49), you need to change the ip From "127.0.0.1" to "Your Ip".
For example, If your ip is "192.168.99.158". Set it (192.168.99.158) to ip. 

# Example
Attacker-ip = 192.168.99.158

$ip = '192.168.99.158';
